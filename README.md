## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ with npm
- macOS (for native app; browser mode works on any OS)

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone and start
git clone <repo-url> personal-dashboard
cd personal-dashboard

make dev    # Backend (port 8000) + frontend (port 5173) with hot reload
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) — the setup wizard will guide you through connecting your services.

### Native macOS App

```bash
make dashboard   # Install deps, build, and launch the native macOS app
```

This updates dependencies, builds the frontend, and opens `Dashboard.app` — a native macOS window powered by pywebview. No browser needed.

## First-Run Setup

On first launch, a setup wizard walks you through:

1. **Profile** — Your name, title, company (optional — personalizes AI prompts)
2. **Connectors** — Enable services and enter credentials right in the app
3. **Done** — Start using the dashboard

All steps are skippable. The dashboard works with zero configuration and you can connect services later in Settings.

## Data Storage

All user data lives in `~/.personal-dashboard/` (configurable via `DASHBOARD_DATA_DIR` env var):

```
~/.personal-dashboard/
  config.json      # Profile, secrets, connector settings (chmod 0600)
  dashboard.db     # SQLite database
```

Secrets are stored in `config.json` with restricted file permissions. Environment variables (`.env`) are also supported as a fallback.

## Connectors

| Connector | Type | What It Syncs |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| Google | OAuth | Gmail, Calendar |
| Google Drive | OAuth | Drive files, Docs, Sheets |
| Microsoft 365 | OAuth | Outlook Email, Calendar (switchable with Google) |
| Microsoft OneDrive | OAuth | OneDrive files, Word, Excel, PowerPoint |
| Slack | API Token | DMs, mentions, channel search |
| Notion | API Token | Recently edited pages |
| GitHub | CLI (`gh`) | Pull requests, issues, code search |
| Granola | Local file | Meeting transcripts and notes |
| Ramp | Client credentials | Transactions, bills, vendors (incremental sync) |
| News | None | URL extraction from Slack/email + Google News RSS |
| Gemini AI | API Key | Powers AI priority rankings, issue discovery, and relevance scoring |

Each connector includes setup instructions in the app. Enable/disable them in Settings.

## Development

```bash

The frontend dev server proxies API requests to `localhost:8000`.

## Architecture

- **Local-only** — runs entirely on your machine, no cloud
- **Single user** — no auth layer, trusted local environment
- **Sync-on-demand** — data syncs manually or via the Sync button; Granola syncs on startup; Ramp supports incremental sync
- **Provider switching** — switch between Google and Microsoft for email and calendar at any time in Settings
- **Plugin connectors** — each service self-registers with metadata
- **AI-powered** — Gemini ranks priorities, discovers issues, scores Drive files and expenses
- **Full-text search** — SQLite FTS indexes across people, notes, meetings, emails, and issues
- **People management** — coworkers vs. contacts, with groups, social links, custom attributes, and relationship tracking
