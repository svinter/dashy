# Personal Dashboard

A local-first personal dashboard that centralizes your email, calendar, Slack, Notion, GitHub, meetings, and more into a single quiet interface. Runs as a native macOS app or in the browser.

## Features

- **AI Priorities**: Morning briefings powered by Gemini, pulling from your email, Slack, calendar, and notes
- **Team Management**: Org chart, 1:1 topic tracking, per-person context pages, meeting history
- **Notes & Issues**: Quick-capture notes with `@mention` autocomplete, plus local issue tracking with priorities and sizing
- **Unified Inbox**: Gmail, Slack, Notion, and GitHub activity in one view
- **News Feed**: Aggregated from your Slack channels, email, and Google News RSS
- **Meetings**: Calendar integration plus Granola transcript sync
- **Embedded Claude Code**: Full Claude Code CLI terminal with persona and session management
- **Global Search**: `Cmd+K` command palette to search across all data sources
- **Plugin Connectors**: Enable/disable services as needed — Google, Slack, Notion, GitHub, Ramp, Granola, and more
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Vim-style navigation, chord shortcuts, and a full shortcut help overlay

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ with npm
- macOS (for native app; browser mode works on any OS)

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone and start
git clone <repo-url> personal-dashboard
cd personal-dashboard

make dev    # Backend (port 8000) + frontend (port 5173) with hot reload
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) — the setup wizard will guide you through connecting your services.

### Native macOS App

```bash
make dashboard   # Install deps, build, and launch the native macOS app
```

This updates dependencies, builds the frontend, and opens `Dashboard.app` — a native macOS window powered by pywebview. No browser needed.

## First-Run Setup

On first launch, a setup wizard walks you through:

1. **Profile** — Your name, title, company (optional — personalizes AI prompts)
2. **Connectors** — Enable services and enter credentials right in the app
3. **Done** — Start using the dashboard

All steps are skippable. The dashboard works with zero configuration and you can connect services later in Settings.

## Data Storage

All user data lives in `~/.personal-dashboard/` (configurable via `DASHBOARD_DATA_DIR` env var):

```
~/.personal-dashboard/
  config.json      # Profile, secrets, connector settings (chmod 0600)
  dashboard.db     # SQLite database
```

Secrets are stored in `config.json` with restricted file permissions. Environment variables (`.env`) are also supported as a fallback.

## Connectors

| Connector | Type | What It Syncs |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| Google | OAuth | Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets |
| Slack | API Token | DMs, mentions, channel search |
| Notion | API Token | Recently edited pages |
| GitHub | CLI (`gh`) | Pull requests, issues, code search |
| Granola | Local file | Meeting transcripts and notes |
| Ramp | Client credentials | Transactions, bills, vendors |
| News | None | URL extraction from Slack/email + Google News RSS |
| Gemini AI | API Key | Powers AI priority rankings |

Each connector includes setup instructions in the app. Enable/disable them in Settings.

## Make Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make dashboard` | Install deps, build, and launch native macOS app |
| `make dev` | Start backend + frontend with hot reload |
| `make build` | Build production frontend |
| `make app` | Build and launch native macOS app (no dep install) |
| `make start` | Same as `make dashboard` |
| `make stop` | Kill servers |
| `make restart` | Stop + start dev mode |
| `make status` | Check if servers are running |
| `make logs` | Tail backend + frontend logs |
| `make lint` | Run Python (ruff) and TypeScript (tsc + eslint) linting |
| `make fmt` | Auto-format Python and TypeScript |

## Development

```bash
# Backend only
cd app/backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend only
cd app/frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend dev server proxies API requests to `localhost:8000`.

## Architecture

- **Local-only** — runs entirely on your machine, no cloud
- **Single user** — no auth layer, trusted local environment
- **Sync-on-demand** — data syncs manually or via the Sync button; Granola syncs on startup
- **Plugin connectors** — each service self-registers with metadata
- **Full-text search** — SQLite FTS indexes across employees, notes, meetings, emails, and issues

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Press `?` in the app to see all shortcuts. Highlights:

- `Cmd+K` — Search / command palette
- `c` — Quick-capture a note
- `s` — Trigger sync
- `r` — Refresh page data
